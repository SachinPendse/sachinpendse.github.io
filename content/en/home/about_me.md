###### I am currently a PhD student in Human-Centered Computing at Georgia Tech, co-advised by [Dr. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) as a part of the [Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/) as a part of the [Technology and Design for Empowerment Lab](http://gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/tandem). 

</br>

Prior to that, I spent a year at [Microsoft Research in Bangalore](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/technology-for-emerging-markets/) as a Research Fellow, advised by [Amit Sharma](http://amitsharma.in/). I did my undergraduate and Masters degrees at Brown University, in [the smallest state with the longest name](https://www.ri.gov/facts/history.php).


###### My research focuses around the question of how the identities we hold (such as our cultural background, our socioeconomic class, our gender identity, or our sexual orientation) have an influence on how we come to [understand](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1005-9_1400) and [express](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00054782) our experiences of distress, as well as what [specific kinds of care](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/12/15/505733704/neighbors-treating-neighbors-for-depression-and-alcoholism) we need and have access to when we aren't feeling well. Through mixed-methods examinations of these factors, I hope to understand the role that technology can play to address the individual and structural barriers that prevent people from consistent mental health.

###### I strongly believe in a future where every person belongs to a caring and supportive community, a world in which all people can experience the full and vibrant spectrum of human emotion, expressing their experiences freely, safely, and powerfully. My research is done [in pursuit of this future](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359302). I also believe every person has an origin story that is interesting and valuable --- you can read more about mine [here](/about_me).
